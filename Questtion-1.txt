Question - 1

Caching can be introduced in any part of a Laravel application. It is most commonly used in Controller and Model.
- Controllers are responsible for handling requests from the client and returning responses. Caching can be used to cache the results of frequently called controller methods.
- Models are responsible for handling the database queries. Caching can be used to cache the results of frequently called database queries.

The Cache facade is a convenient way to cache data in Laravel. It can be used to cache data in memory, on disk, or in a remote cache server.
Memcached and Redis can both be utilized to cache data either in memory or on a remote cache server. 

Advantage
- Caching can help the API server application run more quickly by minimizing the number of database queries, which in turn reduces the load on database connections.
- Achieving a fast response time in API calls requires implementing various strategies to optimize the application's performance.

Disadvantage
- If the cached data is not regularly updated, it might become outdated and inaccurate. 
- Caching can lead to increased code complexity in our application.
